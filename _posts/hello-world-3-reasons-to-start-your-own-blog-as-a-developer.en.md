As a recent grad/newly employed member of the tech workforce, one of the things I misses the most about my college study was 
the English/Art Philosophy classes. Beside my technical curriculum, these classes are enjoyable and memorable because they challenged my critical thinking skill, by not only teaching about the importance of doing thought exercises but also by forcing me to write more. 

Coming from the Vietnamese schooling system, where studying by heart pre-written book analyses to spit them out later onto the Literature test paper is a legitimate strategy, I never thought I could get into writing essays and explaining my ideas in the fancy, elaborated medium of words, sentences, and paragraphs (my experience with Vietnamese schooling is a story for another time). 

Moving to Canada, my understanding of writting as a tool was completely turned up side down. I am grateful that many of my college teachers encourage us and are supportive of us exploring our thesis/ our takes on a subject. For the first time in many years, I finally loved writing and researching because it allows me to organize my thoughts and present them to a wider audience. I finally saw the tremendous benefits of this skill, and with a new surge of free time to fill after graduation, I decided to start building my blog from scratch.  


## Why should you start building your blog from scratch?

In this age of the Internet, where "content is king" as GaryVee often says, blogging is a medium that anyone can get onto, that will give you a lot of value in return:

### 1. Blogging forces you to practice your writing. 
As a developer, this is an extremely underrated skill that is required in my everyday setting. From drafting a clear description of my code changes for others to review, onto formulating design documents to composing a concise and professional email, writing is a first-class asset that everyone should strive to master. Blogging leaves you the freedom to articulate in your language, thus, in a way it is a perfect stepping ground to practice.
 
### 2. As an aspiring or even experienced developer, building your website can serve as a rather convincing portfolio to prove your skills.
There is a wide variety of skills and technology you need to learn to build your blogs and running it. From web architecture to web hosting to designing to analyzing, etc, you will have to dabble into all aspects of the technology stacks to get a website up and running.  For example, I built this blog leveraging NextJS because I want to showcase my React knowledge on the frontend. I also want to try my hand on designing a modern looking website that's accessible and responsive. NextJS also allows me to set up a Server-Side Rendering platform that can serve content fast and efficiently. It's one of the framework that I was completely foreign to, however, through working on this project, I gained much better understanding of it.

### 3. By having a blog, you will have a medium where you are allowed to build your brand organically. 
You can refine your image bases on your interests and from it, build an audience who shares the same fascination. More important, at the end of the day, it is your content and it is up to you to drive and grow it into the vision that you desire while providing valuable insights/entertainment for the reader. For me, my blog will be focusing not only on technology but also on how to navigate/ make sense of my current world view. 

Of course, blogging is a habit and it might take a while to get started. For me, the above three reasons are the biggest benefits that drove me to start this. Hopefully, this will help to motivate you to start your blogging journey!
